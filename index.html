        <h1>Meet the Commander</h1>
        <p id="primer">Abzan is the colour of resilience, and its greatest strength is designed to make you more powerful over time.  
            Abzan thrives in prolonged battles, consistently dealing pinging damage that slowly but surely wears down opponents.
            It is intended to be a slow, unstoppable wave of death. It cannot be stopped, only slowed, and it grows constantly stronger over time.  </p>

            <p id="primer">Myrkul as the commander is unique; he's not needed in order for the deck to function, nor to win the game. The deck is full of creatures with passive abilities
                that either drain life or gain life, and the goal is to keep them on the battlefield as long as possible. You'll find that you barely need to deal combat damage, but instead rely on the passive abilities.
                Myrkul is there to ensure your creatures' resilience, and his true purpose is to bring back fallen creatures as enchantments, exploiting the relative scarcity of enchantment removal. 
                This means your opponents must remove each creature twice to permanently eliminate them from the battlefield.
                This relentless cycle of rebirth creates a battlefield where your threats are never truly gone, overwhelming opponents with an unyielding tide of persistent power.
            </p>

            <p id="primer">This deck uses life as a resource, allowing you to sacrifice health for powerful effects while simultaneously draining your opponents' life.
                With spells that matter with you having more life, this deck plays a strategic balance of sacrificing your own life for greater gains, 
                and draining the vitality of your opponents so that you maintain the upper hand in various situations.</p>
                
                <p id="primer">Whether through persistent damage, life gain, or the sheer ability to endure, this Abzan deck is built to outlast and overcome, turning every sacrifice into a stepping stone towards you standing tall among a kingdom of bones.
                </p>
